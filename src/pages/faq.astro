        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>Why wasn't my ascent logged?</h3>
        <p>
            There are a few possible reasons that a summit attempt was not
            logged.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Your activity track wasn't accurate, and didn't record you
                    achieving the summit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The detection threshold in your <PeakLogger /> settings was too
                    small.
                    {
                        loggedIn && (
                            <span>
                                Visit the <a href='/account'>Settings page</a>.
                            </span>
                        )
                    }
                    <img src='/peaklogger_settings_detection_radius.png' />
                </li>
                <li>
                    The peak does not exist on <PBLink /> or the location of the
                    summit on
                    <PBLink /> is not accurate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If your activity is marked as 'private' (visibility on
                    Strava set to 'Only You') it will only be processed if you
                    authorize <PeakLogger />
                    to access private activities on the <PeakLogger /> settings page.
                    {
                        loggedIn && (
                            <span>
                                Visit the <a href='/account'>Settings page</a>.
                            </span>
                        )
                    }
                </li>
            </ul>

            If you are able to resolve any of the listed issues, you can have
            <PeakLogger /> re-analyze your activity to see if the summits you expect
            are detected.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Why don't my summited peaks show up in my Strava activity
            description?
        </h3>
        <p>
            There are several possible reasons that your ascents didn't show up
            on
            <StravaLink text='Strava' />.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You didn't elect to have your summits logged on
                    <StravaLink text='Strava' /> on the <PeakLogger /> settings page.

                <li>
                    You were updating your <StravaLink text='Strava' /> activity
                    description when <PeakLogger /> attempted to update your activity.
                    Try re-analyzing your activity on <PeakLogger />.

        <p>
            There are several possible reasons that your ascent wasn't logged on <PBLink
            />.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You didn't save your <PBLink /> log-in information on the
                    <PeakLogger /> settings page.

        <h3>Are all activities I post on Strava analyzed?</h3>
        <p>
            No. Only activities that involve some type of locomotion can be

            are analyzed by
            <PeakLogger /> on your account
            {loggedIn && <a href='/account'>Settings page</a>}
            {!loggedIn && <span>Settings page</span>}
            .
